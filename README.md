# Capstone Project Code - Udacity ML Nanodegree

This repo contains the code for the final project of the [Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/machine-learning-engineer-nanodegree--nd009). The aim of this project is to use [reinforcement learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) with [deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning) to create an agent that learns to play the game of [Connect 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) by playing games against itself.
